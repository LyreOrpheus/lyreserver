# LyreOrpheusMusicBot: The music bot for Discord.

MusicBot is a Discord music bot written in [Python](https://www.python.org "Python homepage"). It plays requested songs and if the queue becomes empty it will play through a list of existing songs.

### Great, now how do I use it?
Download the bot, set the dependencies up, then run `runbot.bat`! (or `run.sh` on mac/linux)  Read the tutorial if you don't know what to do.

If you have any errors, read the FAQ. If that didn't help, you can ask for assistance on the discord help server. Is is recommended to take screenshots so the developers can see errors.
